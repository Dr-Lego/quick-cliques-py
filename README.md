# **Quick Cliques**: Quickly compute all maximal cliques in sparse graphs

[![license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-GPL%20v3.0-blue.svg)](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/)

The original intent of this software was to provide exact reproducibility of experimental results from two papers:

*Listing All Maximal Cliques in Large Sparse Real-World Graphs in Near-Optimal Time*,
**D. Eppstein, M. LÃ¶ffler, and D. Strash**,
Journal of Experimental Algorithmics, 18 (3): 3.1, 2013, 
[doi:10.1145/2543629](https://doi.org/10.1145/2543629)

and

*Listing All Maximal Cliques in Large Sparse Real-World Graphs*, 
**D. Eppstein and D. Strash**
Proceedings of the 10th International Conference on Experimental Algorithms (SEA 2011), LNCS vol. 6630, pp. 403-414.
[doi:10.1007/978-3-642-20662-7_31](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-20662-7_31)
[arXiv:1103.0318](https://arxiv.org/abs/1103.0318)

However, in the original implementation (written in C) was not designed to be integrated with other code. It has since been upgraded to C++11, is becoming more hardened, and has better support for integration into other software packages.

Want the exact code from the original experiments? See release v1.0.

###This package includes:

 - C++ code for four implementations for enumerating all maximal cliques of a graph
 - A small set of data used for testing (see ./data) [ For a larger set of data (too large for GitHub), you can download the following: http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dstrash/data.tar.gz ]
 - The test script used to build and run all algorithms on all data sets (./test.sh)

Please feel free to contact me with any questions!

### Version
2.0beta

### Building
