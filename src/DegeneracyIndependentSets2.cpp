    See the algorithm's description in http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-20662-7_31
    and http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-17517-6_36

    This algorithm first orders the vertices in a degeneracy order (vertices
    are removed from the graph in order by degree in the remaining subgraph 
    and placed in this order in the ordering).

    We then recursively call a modified version of the algorithm of Tomita et
    al. (2006) http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tcs.2006.06.015, for each vertex
    v in the ordering, where R = {v}, P = v's neighbors that are after v
    in the degneracy order, and X = v's neighbors that are before v 
    in the degeneracy order.

    This is a recursive backtracking algorithm that maintains three 
    sets of vertices, R, a partial clique, P, the common neighbors
    of vertices in R that are candidates to add to the partial clique,
    and X, the set of common neighbors of R that have been listed 
    in a maximal clique with R already.

    The algorithm recursively adds vertices to R from P, then 
    updates the sets P and X to be the new common neighbors of R
    and recurses. When P and X are empty, R is a maximal clique,
    and is reported.

    Updating the sets P and X is done by iterating over the later
    neighbors of vertices in P and X to see if they contain the vertex
    v added to R as a neighbor, and then testing if v's later neighbors
    are in P or X. Neighbors of v remain in their respective sets. For sparse
    graphs (graphs with low degeneracy) the number of neighbors of any vertex
    that come later in the degeneracy order is expected to be small. Then
    testing for neighbors in this way should be fast.

    Besides the ordering, this algorithm includes more efficient 
    pivot computation for sparse graphs.
    To find a "good" pivot, we must find the vertex in P union X that
    has the most neighbors in P. We accompish this step by maintaining
    a data structure that stores, for each vertex in P union X, its
    neighbors in P.
